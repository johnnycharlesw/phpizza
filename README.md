    - MariaDB
    - Oracle MySQL
    - Facebook MySQL

### Extension and skin policy
* Extensions can be added to the CMS by unzipping their zip files into the `extensions` directory, the same goes for skins.
* All skins other than the PHPizza skin are not considered a part of PHPizza itself and are not derivative works.
* Extensions and skins must be compatible with the PHPizza CMS and must not violate any laws or regulations.
