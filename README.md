# PHPizza CMS
This is a CMS I have been working on for fun.

## Features
* Stores content and skin layouts in Markdown (just like how this README is stored in Markdown)
* Has multiskin functionality
* Supports the following DBMSes:
    - MariaDB
    - Oracle MySQL
    - Facebook MySQL
    - Percona Server
    - SQLite
    - PostgreSQL
* Supports PHP 8.2 and later
* Has a relatively simple database schema
* Has a placeholder in the schema for COPPA compliance

### Extension and skin policy
* Extensions can be added to the CMS by unzipping their zip files into the `extensions` directory, the same goes for skins.
* All skins other than the PHPizza skin are not considered a part of PHPizza itself and are not derivative works.
* Extensions and skins must be compatible with the PHPizza CMS and must not violate any laws or regulations.

### Why AGPL?
The AGPL is a copyleft license that requires any derivative work to be released under the same license. This means that if you modify the PHPizza CMS, you must release your modified version under the AGPL. This is important because it ensures that the CMS remains open-source and that any modifications made by users are not restricted by copyright laws.

The AGPL was used as a license for this project since it prevents tivotization, which is the whole reason I built this CMS to replace WordPress.
